Hexagon LLVM Tools Release version 8.3.07 - Release Notes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Overview ####
- Overview
- General
- Requirements
- Known Issues
- Changes
- Notices

#### General ####

The Hexagon LLVM Tools Release version 8.3 is the first release with
support for Hexagon v67 and v67t architecture. Hexagon Architectures
supported in this release include v55, v56, v60, v60-HVX, v61, v62,
v62-HVX, v65, v65-HVX, v66, v67, and v67t.

This release is based on LLVM.org enhanced with optimizations from the
Qualcomm LLVM team.  As a cross compiler, it runs on x86-64 Linux or
Windows host and generates code for Hexagon targets.

Notes:

LLDB:
- Linux LLDB is built with Python 2.7.8.
- Windows LLDB is built with Python 3.5.1.
- LLDB will ignore the PYTHONHOME variable, and use PYTHONPATH as expected.
- To use LLDB with booter, define the environment variable
  LLDB_HEXAGON_BOOTER_PATH with the path to the booter (bootimg.pbn,
  runelf.pbn, etc.) executable. Load the
  target to debug in LLDB. When you run the program, LLDB will launch
  hexagon-sim with the correct flags to run your target under booter.
- By default, LLDB launches hexagon-sim from <install>/Tools/bin. If you wish
  to use a different hexagon-sim, define LLDB_HEXAGON_SIM_PATH with the path
  to the simulator binary you wish to use.

Please send all support questions and bug reports to your local
Qualcomm Hexagon Customer Support office.

#### Requirements ####
  Minimum memory requirement: 16Gbytes RAM

Windows:
- Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 or newer, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
- 64 bit versions are required.
- If you are compiling cosims, you should use MSVC 2015 to ensure
  compatibility with the simulator.

Linux:

- 64 bit installation of SuSe Linux Enterprise 11 SP3 or newer, or Ubuntu
  14.04 or newer.
- Ubuntu 14.04 requires updates. These commands will
  normally be adequate to install them:
    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
    sudo apt-get install libc6 libc6-dev

#### Known Issues / Limitations ####

LLDB:
- Windows command line editing is not as advanced due to absence of
  libedit.  It is on par with a cmd shell.
- Windows interactive scripting doesn't display the Python prompt correctly.
  It won't display when initially entering script mode, and may or may not
  display before output from a command.

C++11/14:
- Full compliance for C++11/14 is dependent on support from QuRT.
