The debugging example provides three simple programs which guide you through 
the writing, building and debugging of a simple program.  The first example
demonstrates proper structures, padding and alignment.  The second example
demonstrates a misalignment and a crash when simulating this example.  The third
example demonstrates how to bring up the Trace32 source level debugging environment
so you can walk through and debug the program visually.  There is also a Hands-on
training presentation which provides additional insight into the three examples.

To build each program, enter the folder and enter the command make.  This example
assumes that you have either msys or cygwin installed when building in your
Windows environment.
