 This folder contains the support program to generate the control inputs for
 the vrdelta and vdelta instructions in HVX.  The src/_d.c file contains the
 log of the size of the data transformation, n = 64, 128 logn = 6,7 respectively.
 It also contains the pattern required, if a value is dont care place an X
 in the location.

 The makefile builds and simulates the example.  Just type make

 If it is a simple data transform it will attempt to use a simple delta network
 and use only the vrdelta instruction.

 - X - don't cares make this more likely to succeed, simple things like rotates
 work.  If the transform is too complex it will try to implement a benes network,
 if this fails then there are duplicated outputs in the pattern, benes requires
 a permute pattern. This can be fixed by pre or post duplicating the data then
 creating a permute.

 Open the General_permute_network.html web page with a browser to get further
 details on the use of this algorithm. The General_permute_network_files folder
 contains the .png images and java script used by the html file.  Please do not
 change the name of this folder as the html file will not work correctly if you do.
