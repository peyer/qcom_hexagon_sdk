     single precision floating point bkFIR and IIR examples

This folder contains two examples which demonstrate how to compute
single precision floating point filters.  Each example has a test
folder which contains a makefile and make.cmd file which help to
build/simulate the example.

To demonstrate each example do the following:
  cd bkFIR/test
  make

  cd IIR/test
  make
