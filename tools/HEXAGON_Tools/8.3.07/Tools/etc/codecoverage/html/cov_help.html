    <h2> Table of Contents</h2>
    The table of contents contains 2 columns.  The first column is the percent coverage 
    for the file/function represented by that row.  The second column is the name of the 
    file/function.  The second column is also a link to a more detailed view of coverage
    for that file/function.
    <br>- Clicking on the link will open a new view in the right hand
    pane of your browser.
    <br>- Clicking on the weight of a row representing a source file will toggle between the 
    full path and just the file name.
    <br>- Ctrl Click on any weight will toggle all file names between the full path and just the
    file name.

    The source view contains either source code inter-mixed with disassembled object code or only
    disassembled object code when source code is not available.
    <br>- Clicking on the file name at the top of the file will toggle between the full path and just the file name.
    <br>- Double Clicking on a highlighted source line will collapse/expand the disassembled text.
    <br>- Ctrl Double click on any highlighted source line will collapse/expand all disassembled text.
    <br>- Ctrl Up/Down Arrow Key will navigate up/down through the source lines that contain disassembled text.
